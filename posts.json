If it is, the theme switches to light mode. Through changing the body background colours, text colours, and a transition effect. And vice versa for dark mode. To save the theme across pages, the theme is stored in localStorage. "

Inside the for loop, a list item is created, and constructs the HTML for each blog post (h2 for title, p for date & content). Lastly, the catch() is for error handling if any error occurs during the fetch() operation."
