If it is, the theme switches to light mode. Through changing the body background colours, text colours, and a transition effect. And vice versa for dark mode. To save the theme across pages, the theme is stored in localStorage. "

        "content": "Instead of coding a header and a footer for every webpage, making it dynamic allows for easier updates and maintenance. I created custom HTML elements called special-header and special-footer. In JavaScript, I made 2 classes that extends to the HTML elements (one for the header and one for the footer). Then used a connectedCallBack() method, which makes it so my custom HTML element runs automatically when it gets added to the page. Within the method, I then define what the header and footer should look like, using the innerHTML property."
